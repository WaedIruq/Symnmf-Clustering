# Symnmf-Clustering

This project implements a clustering algorithm based on Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF). The goal of this project is to apply SymNMF to various datasets to identify clusters and patterns in the data.

## Overview
The Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) is a powerful technique for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and data analysis. It decomposes a non-negative matrix into two non-negative matrices, capturing the underlying structure of the data. This project implements the SymNMF algorithm and demonstrates its application in clustering tasks.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamedkj18/SymNMF-clustring-project.git
cd SymNMF-clustring-project
```
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your version by running:

```bash
python --version
```
Next, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamedkj18/SymNMF-clustring-project.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd SymNMF-clustring-project
```
Run the main clustering script:

```bash
python symnmf_clustering.py
```
This will perform the SymNMF clustering on the dataset provided in the repository. You can modify the dataset or the parameters in the script as needed.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:

numpy
scipy
sklearn
